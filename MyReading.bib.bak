People were not entertained more by the emotional faces, however this may be due to a lack of dynamic changing during interaction. Also people rated themselves as being happier after dealing with the neutral robot - authors suggest this could be because they were rating relative to the neutral robot they had interacted with?

Lots of experimental detail for inspiration on experiment design. Found evidence for positive affect causing a quantitative increase in performance on both tasks, also showed that exercise (i.e. increasing the arousal but not affect) did not have that same effect. So perhaps could use this as evidence that positive affect should increase performance and then use those tasks to check whether contagion from robot has happened. Or, if go for an exercise based task, then this is evidence that the exercise itself should not impact participants' affect (still need to beware of time decay effects though if self-reporting is delayed).},

Interesting test for death thoughts: word completion e.g. COFF__ could be coffin or coffee; may be able to do something similar for emotion checking after contagion tests? Also notes that the amount participants rated Jules to be 'happy' or 'sad' was much greater in situations where they had just told Jules a happy or sad story respectively; i.e. they project emotions onto the robot/ascribe empathy. This is interestig from a design point of view because it demonstrates just how willing humans are to ascribe emotion to the robot; potentially making our job easier??},

Example: disgust scrunching of nose and mouth would reduce airflow and hence intake of noxious gas, however now used to respond to unagreeable behaviour or information. For me - observer ability to decode important for robot emotion work because examples suggest that response is involuntary; for example assigning higher social status to an agent who displays pride. Second example of fear contagion - monkeys never before scared of snakes became scared of snakes when they saw other monkeys who were so. Could this work for positive emotions? i.e. someone who doesn't like a task actually begins to like it after seeing a robot like it (obvious applications in therapy, education etc. and seemingly obvious if you think about parents conving their children to eat their greens by saying how tasty they are etc.)},
